### **Installation Guide**

To get started with Aether Cloud Gaming, follow these installation steps:

#### **Prerequisites**
- **Operating System**: Linux-based systems are recommended (Ubuntu 20.04 or later).
- **Hardware**: A powerful server with a dedicated GPU is recommended for the best performance. We recommend NVIDIA GPUs for optimal support.
- **Software**: Docker, Docker Compose, Git, and other necessary tools.

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
First, clone the Aether Cloud Gaming repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sky-Genesis-Enterprise/aether-cloud-gaming.git
```

#### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd aether-cloud-gaming
```

Then install Docker and Docker Compose if you don't have them already:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

Ensure Docker is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

#### **Step 3: Configure the Environment**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to define your environment settings, such as the server’s IP address, game directory, and other variables. Here's an example of the configuration file:

```bash
GAME_DIRECTORY=/path/to/games
SERVER_IP=192.168.1.100
GPU_DRIVER=nvidia
```

#### **Step 4: Set Up the Docker Containers**
Use Docker Compose to set up all the necessary containers. This will pull the required Docker images and set up the necessary components for Aether Cloud Gaming to run.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the backend services, including the game streaming server, the authentication service, and the web dashboard.

#### **Step 5: Configure Frontend**
You can also configure the frontend application for the web interface. It’s a responsive application designed for easy use on browsers. Follow the instructions in the **frontend** directory to build and deploy it:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

Serve the application:

```bash
npm start
```

#### **Step 6: Secure the Platform with Aether Secure**
For enhanced security, integrate **Aether Secure** into your Aether Cloud Gaming platform. Follow the setup instructions in the Aether Secure documentation to implement end-to-end encryption, firewalls, and other security measures.

#### **Step 7: Test the Setup**
Once the installation is complete, visit the web interface to log in and test the service. Ensure that the server is accessible, and games can be streamed smoothly.
